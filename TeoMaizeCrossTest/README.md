# Testing the Gene Incompatibility hypothesis/analysis pipeline on Maize:Teosinte data

The purpose of this example project is to use RNA-Seq data from the paper Lemmon et al. 2014.

Paper found here: http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004745

Lemmon et al. made crosses between teosinte inbred lines and maize inbred lines.

I'm downloading some of the F1 RNA-Seq data, and working on the analysis pipeline.
